# MD68000
WIP Emulation of the SEGA Mega Drive's Hardware.
This repository is to highlight the ways of which I am able to emulate the MD/Genesis' Hardware in the hopes of making an Emulator

## Inspiration
This Project was heavily inspired by OneLoneCoder's NES Emulation series and I wanted to see if I would be able to expand my technical skill to
create something similar but unique in it's entirety

Several inspirations for this Project include the Dolphin Emulator as well as KEGA Fusion
